This is a very basic Blogging engine, specifically written to host blog.wolfman.com.

Written in Merb as a way to learn Merb, and compare and contrast to Rails.

Uses HAML as the rendering engine and Sequel as the ORM.

I haven't written the tests yet (bad boy!). I love RSpec, so I'll do
the tests when I have some spare time, but I wanted to get this blog
up a running and serving my blog ASAP.
