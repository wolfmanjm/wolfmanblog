This is a very basic Blogging engine, specifically written to host blog.wolfman.com.

Written in Merb as a way to learn Merb, and compare and contrast to Rails.

Uses HAML as the rendering engine and Sequel as the ORM.

I haven't written the tests yet (bad boy!). I love RSpec, so I'll do
the tests when I have some spare time, but I wanted to get this blog
up a running and serving my blog ASAP.

The sidebar components (ads, tags, categories etc) use parts, where
each sidebar component is an action in the parts controller, and has a
view for each sidebar component, then the sidebar components (ie
parts) are listed in ther order they should appear in the global
layout.

It has RSS feeds for comments and articles.

Has a simple admin mode which allows the admin to delete posts or
comments, and to upload new articles.

Has a ridiculously simple scheme for stopping spambots, which actually
seems to work very well.

To run the cucumber based features you need to...

> gem sources -a http://gems.github.com  
> sudo gem install cucumber      
> sudo gem install webrat   
> sudo gem install jsmestad-merb_cucumber

I didn't add these to the dependencies (for bundling) as they are not required for production.

So I'll add integration tests now I have cucumber installed and the authentication feature it 
installed worked.
